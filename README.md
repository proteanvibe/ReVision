Open-source and modular vision therapy software

Design Methodology:

The intention of this software is to provide organization and tracking for Vision Therapy modules. Each VT module will provide some exercise or experience related to VT. This software provides users, tracking, and configuration/calibration. I wanted to allow for flexibility in how the modules are written, so that each module essentially stands alone.

Goals:

To create a fully functional software package that provides the elements necessary for use by Vision Therapists and Patients.
